# Metis AI Community (MAC)

## Overview

The Metis AI Community (MAC) is a community-led initiative designed to accelerate open-source AI development on the Metis L2 ecosystem. Through a decentralized bounty system, MAC provides an efficient funding mechanism for AI-related development requests, enabling collaborative innovation across the Metis ecosystem.

## Mission

To foster an environment where AI projects can collectively fund development, while providing direct incentives for developers to build open-source AI-driven features that scale the Metis ecosystem.

## Core Features

### Decentralized Bounty System
- Community-managed multisig wallet for multi-token rewards
- Transparent funding mechanism for AI-related development
- Open participation model for developers and projects

### Development Request (DR) Framework
- Structured process for proposing AI-related features
- Clear documentation and submission guidelines
- Community-driven prioritization of development needs

### Collaborative Development Model
- Shared infrastructure development
- Open-source code requirements
- Ecosystem-wide benefit focus

## How It Works

1. **Project Proposals**
   - Projects submit Development Requests (DRs)
   - DRs must benefit multiple projects with AI features on Metis L2
   - Clear documentation of requirements and success criteria

2. **Funding Mechanism**
   - Multi-token rewards pooled in community multisig
   - Projects can co-sponsor development efforts
   - Transparent fund management and distribution

3. **Development Process**
   - Open bounties for developer participation
   - Clear milestones and deliverables
   - Community review and approval process

4. **Integration and Implementation**
   - Open-source code availability
   - Documentation for ecosystem integration
   - Shared benefit across participating projects
